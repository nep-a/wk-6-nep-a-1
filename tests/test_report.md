# 🧾 CleanCity Test Report

**Date:** [18/11/2025]  
**Phase 3:** Test Design & Early Execution   

---

## Project Overview
The Clean City Project is a web-based sustainability platform enabling citizens to report waste, view cleanup events, and volunteer for environmental causes. The system includes a user interface, forms, event listings, and an admin dashboard.

---
1. Purpose & Scope
This document explains how we will test the CleanCity waste pickup scheduling system. Our goal is to make sure users can:
•	Submit pickup requests
•	Register/log in
•	Track recycling status
•	Give feedback
•	View awareness information
•	Admins can update request statuses
We’ll test the app manually and with automated React tests to confirm it works smoothly, looks right on multiple devices, and stores data properly.
Scope
(In-scope):
•	Home Page: pickup request form and validation
•	User Registration & Login
•	Dashboard: listing, filtering, and status display
•	Feedback page submission, and request ID validation 
•	Awareness page: content and accessibility checks
•	Admin panel: update statuses, UI state, persistence via localStorage
•	Responsive layout on desktop and mobile viewports
•	Automated unit/integration tests with React Testing Library
Out-of-scope:
•	Backend API tests 
•	Advanced Security penetration testing
•	Performance load testing 
2. Test Objectives
We need to verify all functional requirements (submit requests, view requests, filter, update status). Validate form inputs and error messages. Confirm data persistence. Check accessibility Ensure UI responds on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Execute automated test suite and verify passing tests for key flows.
3. Test Approach & Strategy
Strategies used:
•	Manual Exploratory & Scripted Testing: Execute explicit test cases for forms, filtering, admin actions, and feedback.
•	Boundary Testing: Inputs with very long strings, invalid dates, missing required fields.
•	Accessibility Checks: Manual screen reader checks, keyboard navigation, and Lighthouse a11y audits.
•	Automated Tests: Use React Testing Library to validate core component logic and form validation behavior.
•	Data Persistence Checks: Use browser devtools to inspect localStorage after actions.
Test Types:
•	Functional tests (positive/negative)
•	Usability & Accessibility tests
•	Responsive tests
•	Regression tests after bug fixes
•	Automated unit/integration tests 
Environments:
•	Development: localhost:3000 (React dev server)
•	Browser targets: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari; ensuring desktop and mobile simulation
•	Node.js
4. Entry & Exit Criteria
Entry Criteria:
•	Application starts successfully.

7. Risk & Mitigation
Risk	Impact	Likelihood	Mitigation
Form validation failures (intentional bug)	High (affects core functionality)	High	Log as P0; create ticket and re-test after fix.
localStorage not updating UI	Medium	Medium	Reproduce steps, capture devtools logs, create issue; consider forced re-render as temp fix.
Missing alt-text in Awareness images	Medium (accessibility)	High	Add alt attributes; add to acceptance criteria.
Cross-browser layout differences	Low–Medium	Medium	Test in target browsers; adjust CSS breakpoints.

•	Priority: P0
TC-003 — Date validation bug check (intentional)
•	Feature: Date validation
•	Steps:
1.	In form, leave other required fields valid but input invalid past date or empty date if the requirement expects a date — exercise the known bug.
•	Expected Result: According to spec, date is optional, but known bug: "date field doesn't show validation error" — log behavior as observed.
•	Priority: P1
TC-010 — Filter by location (Eldoret)
•	Feature: Dashboard filtering
•	Steps:
1.	Go to Dashboard.

•	Priority: P1
TC-070 — Boundary testing: very long input
•	Feature: Boundary testing
•	Steps:
1.	In Full Name, enter 5,000 characters.
2.	Submit the form.
•	Expected Result: Application handles gracefully — truncated or rejected with a validation message; layout not broken. If layout breaks, record as bug.
•	Priority: P2
11. Automated Tests
Recommended automated tests to implement with React Testing Library:
•	Render pickup form and assert required fields and error messages (TC-001, TC-002).
•	Simulate filter controls on dashboard and assert filtered output (TC-010).
•	Test admin status update function updates storage and returns expected data (TC-040).
•	Snapshot tests for major components (home, dashboard, admin) to catch UI regressions.
Example Jest test skeleton:
// sample: PickupForm.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import PickupForm from '../PickupForm';

test('shows error when full name is empty', () => {
  render(<PickupForm />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Submit Request/i));
  expect(screen.getByText(/required/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Run with: npm test
12. Defect Reporting & Management
Tool: Use GitHub Issues and Jira. Each defect should include:
•	Title (clear short summary)
•	Description (steps to reproduce, expected vs actual)
•	Environment (browser, OS, app version)
•	Severity (P0/P1/P2)
•	Attachments (screenshots, console logs)
•	Assignee & label (bug/UX/accessibility)
Severity Definitions:
•	P0 (Critical): Core functionality broken (submit request fails, filter returns wrong dataset). Blocker for release.
•	P1 (High): Important features affected or major UX problems (missing alt text, persistence issues).
•	P2 (Medium): Nice-to-have fixes or cosmetic issues (layout quirks).
•	P3 (Low): Low impact, suggestions.
